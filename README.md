# Distributed Dingsbums Finder

Completely decentralized solution to discover and interact with dingsbums.

Dingsbums is a placeholder (from German) to mean anything, in our particular case we focused on charging stations and parking spaces for electric vehicles.

##Motivation
Centralized clearing platforms add complexity and inefficiency to value chain, therefore we want to realize machine to machine communication to cut out the inefficient middleman.

Further explanation can be found in the powerpoint presentation included in this repo under [the releases](https://github.com/blockchained-mobility-hack/finding-agents/tree/submission).
